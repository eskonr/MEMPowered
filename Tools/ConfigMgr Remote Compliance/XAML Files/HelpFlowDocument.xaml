            <Bold>ConfigMgr Remote Compliance</Bold>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            <Bold>ConfigMgr Remote Compliance</Bold> can be used to view, evaluate and report on System Center Configuration Manager Compliance Baselines on a remote computer. 
            It provides similar functionality to the <Bold>Configurations</Bold> tab of the Configuration Manager Control Panel, but for remote computers.
            It is a useful troubleshooting tool for remotely viewing client compliance, evaluating baselines, viewing the evaluation report or opening DCM log files from the client, without
            needing to access the target computer directly.

            Using the Tool
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph FontWeight="SemiBold">
            Get Configurations
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Enter the target computer name or IP address in the <Bold>ComputerName</Bold> box and hit enter or click <Bold>Get-Configurations</Bold>. The tool will connect to WMI on the target computer to retrieve
            the Configurations and display them in the datagrid.

        <Paragraph FontWeight="SemiBold">
            Machine Settings vs User Settings
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Some compliance items run in the context of the logged-on user, therefore it is a little more difficult to work with those remotely without running in the context of that user. However, the tool will detect the logged-on
            user (assuming there is one) and then determine the <Bold>Compliance State</Bold> of any compliance baselines that are user-targeted rather than machine targeted, <Bold>in the context of that user</Bold>. It will not report the 
            <Bold>Last Evaluation</Bold> date or the <Bold>Evaluation Status</Bold> for user-targeted baselines. The username of the logged-on user will be displayed against any user-targeted baselines in the datagrid.
            <LineBreak/>
            For machine-targeted baselines, the full data is returned.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph FontWeight="SemiBold">
            Evaluate
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            For machine-targeted baselines only, you can remotely trigger an evaluation of that baseline by selecting it in the datagrid and clicking <Bold>Evaluate</Bold>. The tool will trigger the evaluation and wait for it to complete
            before refreshing the data in the datagrid.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph FontWeight="SemiBold">
            View Report
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            For either user or machine-targeted baselines, you can view the same html report generated by the <Bold>View Report</Bold> button in the Configuration Manager Control Panel. Select a baseline then click <Bold>View Report</Bold>.

            Viewing Client Log Files
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            The tool can open some of the commonly-used log files for desired configuration management on the target computer for additional troubleshooting.

            Logging
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Basic logging is provided in the <Bold>Logging</Bold> window. Click the expander to view the log.

            Using with the local computer
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            The tool is intended to be used against a remote computer, but it can also be used against the local computer if desired. To run against the local computer, run as administrator to access all the features.
