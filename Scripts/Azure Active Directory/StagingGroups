Create dynamic groups for % of device to be used for staged deployments.  Because this staging is based on the last digit of the device object ID in Entra ID, and that is a hex value, it can 1 of 16 alternatives.

Thus to have automated increasing group size content for deployments, these groups can now be used:

Group name
% of total
Group membership
Contains
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Physical Computers Phased Deploy 1
6.25
3187
Physical devices whose objectid ends with 'a'
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Physical Computers Phased Deploy 2
25
12967
Physical devices whose objectid ends with 'abcd'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1)
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Physical Computers Phased Deploy 3
50
18229
Physical devices whose objectid ends with 'abcdef01'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1 and Deploy 2)
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Physical Computers Phased Deploy 4
75
36556
Physical devices whose objectid ends with 'abcdef012345'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1, Deploy 2 and Deploy 3)
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All All India Virtual Computers Phased Deploy 1
6.25
1138
Virtual devices whose objectid ends with 'a'
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All All India Virtual Computers Phased Deploy 2
25
4553
Virtual devices whose objectid ends with 'abcd'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1)
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All All India Virtual Computers Phased Deploy 3
50
9267
Virtual devices whose objectid ends with 'abcdef01'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1 and Deploy 2)
Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All All India Virtual Computers Phased Deploy 4
75
13934
Virtual devices whose objectid ends with 'abcdef012345'

(i.e. Also includes members from Deploy 1, Deploy 2 and Deploy 3)

After the 'deploy 4' groups are used, the final step for deployment would be to remove all of these groups and add the production groups instead:

Physicals:
Intune - Windows Computers - Physical - All HK SG IN Group 1
Intune - Windows Computers - Physical - All HK SG IN Group 2

Virtuals:
Intune - Windows Computers - Virtual - All HK SG IN

Since we can't dynamically go < 1/16 of a group's content, manual groups are needed if you want to do a '1000' member pilot.  If this is the case then vendor should pick this count from groups 'Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Physical Computers Phased Deploy 1' and 'Intune - Dynamically Added Computers - All HK SG IN Virtual Computers Phased Deploy 1' above.

Also, if you need more deployment phases, we can of course create additional groups with member counts in between the above thresholds that was created above.
