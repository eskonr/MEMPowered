### Key Takeaways:

- **Windows Hello for Business** is especially suited for enterprise environments where devices are primarily Windows-based. It provides a seamless and secure user experience but is tied to the Windows ecosystem.

- **Passkeys (Authenticator/Hardware Tokens)** offer flexibility and portability, making them ideal for a variety of online services and cross-platform use. However, they require the user to manage and keep track of the tokens or devices.

- **Entra ID Passwordless** provides a modern authentication method that's deeply integrated into Microsoft services, using biometrics or app-based authentication to enhance security without passwords.

- **Temporary Access Pass (TAP)** offers a convenient solution for scenarios where temporary access is needed, providing a secure, time-limited pass without requiring long-term credentials.

Each solution enhances security by reducing reliance on traditional passwords and can often be used together to provide layered security, depending on the specific needs and context of the organization or user.
